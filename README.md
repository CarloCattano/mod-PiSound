##### [MOD Devices](https://moddevices.com/) software install script for Raspberry OS 64bit with [PiSound hat](https://blokas.io/pisound/) from Blokas Labs
*** 
_use at your own risk!_ _still not widely tested and unsafe_

to install make sure to run setUsername first. This will replace the username in the scripts with your raspberry $USER

```sh setUsername.sh```

```sh install.sh```

your user must be added to a group called audio and other perks explained in the [Linux Audio Wiki](https://wiki.linuxaudio.org/wiki/system_configuration) for best performance


This is an modification from the original repo to work with PiSound hat and some other changes to make it work good on a fresh raspberry pi

The audio settings are in jack.service where you can change the buffer size, sample rate etc.

Plugins must be compiled by you either using the [MOD plugin builder](https://github.com/moddevices/mod-plugin-builder)
or manually compile any lv2 that you wish and create a mod GUI for it using [MOD sdk](https://github.com/moddevices/mod-sdk)

The setup allows to use MOD software alongside other programs like sequencers, plugin hosts or other daws and route the audio at will using any jack patching tool

 If you want to overclock your pi to 1.8 GHz instead of the default 1.5 GHz consider using a fan or other means of cooling, things can warm up to 80ÂºC!
 You do so by adding ```arm_boost=1``` in your ```/boot/config.txt```
